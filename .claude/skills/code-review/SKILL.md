# code-review

Run before every code commit. Acts as a gate — do not commit if any subagent returns FAIL.

**Skip for:** pure doc updates, config-only changes, chore commits with no logic changes.

---

## Step 1 — Get the diff

```bash
git diff --staged
```

If nothing is staged, stage the relevant files first. Pass the diff output to all subagents.

---

## Step 2 — Spawn subagents in parallel

Launch all three at the same time with the Task tool:

### Subagent A — Security Review

Prompt:
> Review the following git diff for security issues. Check for:
> - Hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
> - Command injection, XSS, SQL/NoSQL injection risks
> - Firebase Security Rule gaps: missing auth checks, overly permissive rules, missing field validation on writes
> - Any logic that lets unauthenticated users read or write data they shouldn't
> - Exposed internal data structures in API responses
>
> Output: PASS or FAIL, followed by a numbered list of findings (empty list if PASS).
>
> Diff:
> [paste diff]

### Subagent B — Project Pattern Consistency

Prompt:
> Review the following git diff for consistency with this project's patterns.
>
> Key patterns to enforce:
> - Firestore collection names: `points_of_interest`, `categories`, `tags`, `icons`, `users`, `businesses`, `clicks`
> - `clicks` is a TOP-LEVEL collection (never a subcollection)
> - `icons` documents have `path` field (NOT `url`, NOT `storagePath`)
> - `categories` documents have `color`, `iconId`, `iconUrl` fields
> - Roles: `admin`, `content_manager`, `business_user`, `standard_user` (no other values)
> - Storage rules use `request.auth.token.role` (custom claims) — NEVER `firestore.get()`
> - Firestore rules use `get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid))` for role checks
> - Denormalize fields (e.g. `iconUrl` on categories) rather than doing extra reads at query time
> - `clicks` documents must have exactly: `poiId`, `categoryId`, `timestamp`
>
> Output: PASS or FAIL, followed by a numbered list of findings (empty list if PASS).
>
> Diff:
> [paste diff]

### Subagent C — Code Quality

Prompt:
> Review the following git diff for code quality issues. Flag both over-engineering AND under-engineering.
>
> **Over-engineering (too much complexity):**
> - Abstractions, helpers, or utilities created for a single use
> - Dead code: unused variables, functions, imports
> - Premature generalization: designing for hypothetical future requirements not in the work plan
> - Unnecessary backwards-compatibility shims or feature flags
> - Validation in the wrong place: only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs) — don't re-validate internal data
>
> **Under-engineering (missing structure that should be there):**
> - Repeated logic (3+ similar lines) that should be extracted into a shared function
> - Shared utilities, types, or Firebase config that should live in `shared/` but were duplicated
> - React patterns that should be used but weren't: custom hooks for reusable stateful logic, component decomposition for reused UI, context for app-wide state
> - Firebase SDK patterns skipped in favor of raw fetch or manual workarounds
> - TypeScript types missing where they'd prevent bugs (any used where a proper type exists or is obvious)
>
> **Missing error handling:**
> - Unhandled promise rejections
> - Uncaught Firebase errors at system boundaries
>
> Output: PASS or FAIL, followed by a numbered list of findings (empty list if PASS).
>
> Diff:
> [paste diff]

## Step 3 — Aggregate results

| Subagent | Result |
|----------|--------|
| A — Security | PASS / FAIL |
| B — Patterns | PASS / FAIL |
| C — Code Quality | PASS / FAIL |

**If all PASS** → proceed to commit.

**If any FAIL** → fix all findings, re-stage, and re-run this skill before committing.

---

## Step 4 — Commit

Once all subagents pass:

```bash
git commit -m "<type>: <description>"
```
