## Post-Launch Refinements (2026-02-21)

Fixes and polish applied after initial Phase 4 deploy, outside the original work plan:

| Fix | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Subcategory model | Replaced tag-group faceted filtering with per-category subcategories (`subcategories` collection); filter is AND-across-groups, OR-within-group, scoped to each POI's category |
| Demo mode production | Removed `import.meta.env.DEV` guard from demo toggle; created `scripts/seed-demo.mjs` to seed production Firestore with 6 categories, 15 location tags, 36 subcategories, 1 showcase POI |
| Mobile POI panel | Fixed cut-off by using `dvh` and subtracting 120px bottom-sheet height on mobile |
| Duplicate demo data | Fixed: mock POIs now reference real seeded Firestore IDs; MOCK_CATEGORIES/MOCK_TAGS/MOCK_SUBCATEGORIES removed from merge |
| Location filter UX | Replaced collapsible pills with native `<select>` dropdown + sub-region pills; switching regions auto-clears previous selection |
| Subcategory filter UX | Auto-expands when exactly 1 category selected; collapsed by default for multiple; RTL arrow (◂/▾); hint text when no category selected |
| Scroll indicator | Fade gradient + down-arrow in bottom sheet; only shows when content actually overflows (checked via `requestAnimationFrame` on open) |
| Footer shadow | `z-index` fix so shadow renders above scroll sibling |
| Map south bound | Extended from 29.3° → 28.5° to allow seeing Eilat on mobile with bottom sheet covering 70vh |
| Firestore rules deploy | Deployed `subcategories` allow-read rule that was written but not deployed |

## Known Deviations from Work Plan

- `clicks` in the work plan referenced "subcollection" in 1.5 and 4.5 — implemented as **flat top-level collection** as designed
- Firestore `businesses` read rule had a string/path type mismatch bug (comparison always returned false); fixed in testing phase by using string concatenation instead of path literal
- Google Maps API key HTTP referrer restrictions deferred until hosting domain is set up
- Firestore rules use `request.auth.token.role` (custom claims) instead of `get()` on users collection — safer, avoids failures when user doc doesn't exist
- `onUserCreated` Cloud Function stuck at old trigger type (`beforeUserCreated`) in production — needs manual delete from Firebase Console to redeploy as Gen1 `auth.user().onCreate`
- Phase 6.1 all 3 apps now fully deployed: admin, user-web, business dashboard
- Phase 3 split work-plan 3.3 into 3.3 (POI list) + 3.4 (POI edit) — LLD makes this clearer
- Phase 4 gains step 4.6 (mobile bottom sheet) — not in original work plan; Design א chosen from prototype
